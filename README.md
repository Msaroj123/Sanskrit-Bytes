# Sanskrit-Bytes : Capturing the Essence of Sanskrit in English
This project
focuses on the generation of English descriptions for Sanskrit Shlokas or text using
retrained GPT model. We aimed to make the Ramayans deep wisdom more acces-
sible to English readers by utilizing corresponding information from both Sanskrit
and English texts. This approach was designed to overcome the language and cul-
tural barriers between these two historical languages. The project demonstrates
the successful generation of accurate and contextually relevant English descrip-
tions, unlocking the transformative power of artificial intelligence in preserving
ancient wisdom. To ensure accurate and contextually relevant English descrip-
tions, we prepared a high-quality parallel dataset comprising Sanskrit Ramayan
Shlokas and their corresponding English translations.
